# E-Commerce: Customer Behavior & Engagement Analysis

## Project Definition

This project analyzes customer behavior on a traditional e-commerce platform to uncover funnel bottlenecks, identify high-value customer segments, and build predictive models for strategic targeting.

The dataset presents 276 features of 112,610 users.

## Project Objectives

### 1. Project Goal
> Analyze user behavior on a traditional e-commerce platform using the REES46 dataset to:
- Identify the key behavioral drivers of high customer value.
- Understand drop-offs in the user funnel (view → cart → purchase).
- Segment users based on value, engagement, and session patterns.
- Derive actionable insights to optimize product placement, timing, and conversion strategies.

### 2. Objectives
> Behavioral Funnel Analysis
- Where do users drop off?
- How fast do users act?
- Do high engagement ratios = higher revenue?

> Customer Segmentation
- Which segments deliver the most value?
- How do behaviors differ by value tier?
- Which segments are risky or unprofitable?

> Predictive Modeling
- Build a classifier to prioritize big spenders.
- Build a model to identify users likely to stop purchasing.

### Key Insights
- Funnel leak is largest at the view → cart stage.
- High-value users take more time, yet are more deliberate and profitable.
- Power buyers are only 20%, but drive 84% of total revenue.
- Engagement ratios like cart/view and session ratio are leading indicators of value.
- Predictive models enable early targeting and churn prevention.
